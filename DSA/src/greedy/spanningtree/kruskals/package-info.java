/**
 * Greedy approach for minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's Algorithm.<br>
 * Algorithm says that we must keep including minimum edges till the edges don't from cycle.
 * 
 * <br>
 * To find edges we use disjoin subsets, we may also use maps for that case.<br>
 * Disjoint sets use collapsible fins and weigted unions to detect cycle on inclusion of a subtree.
